## Course Description

Feature Engineering Studio is a core course of the Learning Analytics Program and preference is given to students within this course of study. FES is a design studio style course that tackles real world data problems assocaited with technology use in education. Students will work in groups with outside organizations on data projects pertinent to eudcational problems. They will be required to respond to briefs supplied by the organizations and perform all parts of the workflow to generate data solutions for those organizations including, 
data cleaning and access, feature engineering and distillation, visualization, and final deliverables.

## Educational Goals

* Obtain experience with real-world educational data problems in context
* Setup an automated data collection operation
* Begin a project for use as Capstone project
* Develop workforce readiness and job search skills

## Assessment

Assessemnt is broken down into team and individual deliverables.

### Individual Deliverables:

* SQL Test
* Updated LinkedIn account 
* Updated Github account 
* Attend a relevant EdTech/Data Science event (AWS Summit)

### Team Deliverables

#### Class Project
* Design & deliver a section of an Online Class in which you collect data
* Presentation of analysis of that data
* Attend and present on an EdTech event

#### Placement Project
* Students must complete their placement with an outside organization
* The placement organization must be approved by Prof. Lang and an introduction provided to the supervisor from that organization
* A memorandum of understanding including description of deliverables must be signed by the placement supervisor
* Privacy policies that govern data use & any specific non-disclosure agreements must be provided
* Project timeline, finishing date and division of labor must be provided
* Notification of final deliverable as defined in consultation with placement supervisor must be provided before degree completion

## Relationship to Learning Analytics Program Capstone Project

Site projects started in FES are intended to become Capstone Projects for completion of the Learning Analytics Masters Program.

## Fine Print

1. All examinations, papers, and other graded work and assignments are to be completed in conformance with the [Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.tc.columbia.edu/administration/diversity/index.asp? Id=Civility+Resources+and+Policies&Info=Civility+Resources+and+Policies&Area=Studen t+Miscon duct+Policy). Students who intentionally submit work either not their own or without clear attribution to the original source, fabricate data or other information, engage in cheating, or misrepresentation of academic records may be subject to charges. Sanctions may include dismissal from the college for violation of the TC principles of academic and professional integrity fundamental to the purpose of the College.

2. The College will make reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. Students are encouraged to contact the Office of Access and Services for Individuals with Disabilities for information about registration (166 Thorndike Hall). Services are available only to students who are registered and submit appropriate documentation. As your instructor, I am happy to discuss specific needs with you as well.

3. The grade of Incomplete will be assigned only when the course attendance requirement has been met but, for reasons satisfactory to the instructor, the granting of a final grade has been postponed because certain course assignments are outstanding. If the outstanding assignments are completed within one calendar year from the date of the close of term in which the grade of Incomplete was received and a final grade submitted, the final grade will be recorded on the permanent transcript, replacing the grade of Incomplete, with a transcript notation indicating the date that the grade of Incomplete was replaced by a final grade. If the outstanding work is not completed within one calendar year from the date of the close of term in which the grade of Incomplete was received, the grade will remain as a permanent Incomplete on the transcript. In such instances, if the course is a required course or part of an approved program of study, students will be required to re-enroll in the course including repayment of all tuition and fee charges for the new registration and satisfactorily complete all course requirements. If the required course is not offered in subsequent terms, the student should speak with the faculty advisor or Program Coordinator about their options for fulfilling the degree requirement. Doctoral students with six or more credits with grades of Incomplete included on their program of study will not be allowed to sit for the certification exam.

4. Teachers College students have the responsibility for activating the Columbia University Network ID (UNI) and a free TC Gmail account. As official communications from the College – e.g., information on graduation, announcements of closing due to severe storm, flu epidemic, transportation disruption, etc. -- will be sent to the student’s TC Gmail account, students are responsible for either reading email there, or, for utilizing the mail forwarding option to forward mail from their account to an email address which they will monitor.

5. It is the policy of Teachers College to respect its members’ observance of their major religious holidays. Students should notify instructors at the beginning of the semester about their wishes to observe holidays on days when class sessions are scheduled. Where academic scheduling conflicts prove unavoidable, no student will be penalized for absence due to religious reasons, and alternative means will be sought for satisfying the academic requirements involved. If a suitable arrangement cannot be worked out between the student and the instructor, students and instructors should consult the appropriate department chair or director. If an additional appeal is needed, it may be taken to the Provost.
